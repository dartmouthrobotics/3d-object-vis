This repository is based on [3D-Detection-Tracking-Viewer](https://github.com/hailanyi/3D-Detection-Tracking-Viewer). But modified slightly for 2 purposes:

1. Easier to save visualization pictures with configurable scale
   - Add `offscreen` param in `Viewer`
   - Add `save_name & scale` in `Viewer.show_3D`
2. Set the camera position at my own preferences
   - Change `self.vi.show(camera)` settings in `Viewer.show_3D` 

## Usage

### Requirement

1. You need to`pip install vedo` to visualize your prediction. For more details, please refere to  [3D-Detection-Tracking-Viewer](https://github.com/hailanyi/3D-Detection-Tracking-Viewer).
2. You need to `pip install tqdm` to show the progress bar.
3. You need to `pip install opencv-python` to concat 3D & 2D images.

### Data

You can organize your data like this, just like KITTI

```
- data_root
  - velodyne
  - image_2
```

### Scripts

**Main function is in** `vis.py`. Most of the funcionalities are commented, and some were written in Chinese, but overall it's easy to read. Please check the scripts in `vis.py` after `if __name__ == '__main__':` to see the basic usage.

You can also easily start with the codes below

```python
from viewer.viewer import Viewer

def build_viewer(box_type="OpenPCDet", bg=(255,255,255), offscreen=False):
    return Viewer(box_type=box_type, bg=bg, offscreen=offscreen)

vi = build_viewer()
vi.add_points(points)   # (N, 3), (x, y, z)
vi.add_3D_boxes(boxes)  # (N, 7), (x, y, z, w, h, l, theta)
vi.show_3D()
```

If you want to visualize your prediction results, you can get your inference results `result.pkl` by running with OpenPCDet project. OR you can try `inference.py` provided in this repo, which is also built on OpenPCDet `demo.py`.

```shell
python inference.py --cfg_file {CONFIG_FILE} \
    --ckpt {CKPT} \
    --data_path {POINT_CLOUD_DATA}
```

## Demo

I've made some demo videos to show the results:

1. [3D Object Detection Visualization Demo](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1h3411t7sc)
2. [3D Object Segmentation (Car) Demo](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1oT4y1f71D)



## MJ note
* result.pkl: eval result from OpenPCD. Each model seperately 
* run: python vis.py
